      Destiny 2 is a free-to-play online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. It became a free-to-play title on October 1, 2019, followed by the game's release on Google Stadia the following month.when Bungie acquired the publishing rights to the franchise. It is the sequel to 2014's Destiny and its subsequent expansions. These new activities have an emphasis on exploration of the planets and interactions with non-player characters ; the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.
Players assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the Last City from different alien races. A third, large expansion, Forsaken, was released in September 2018, beginning Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into Destiny 2: Forsaken Legendary Collection. An annual pass was also available alongside this release, containing three premium content drops for Year Two.
